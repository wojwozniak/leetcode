# Rust Leetcode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Leetcode problems, implemented in Rust. I'm following the NeetCode roadmap as a starting point, and plan to expand to other problem sets over time.

Each solution includes a brief explanation - idea and time complexity analysis. This project helps me deepen my understanding of Rust while sharpening my algorithm and data structure skills.

Some problems will be solved in C (a couple does not have Rust option on website (and it feels better to work with linked lists in C))
